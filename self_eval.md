# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    - I struggled through most of the final_practice.rb part of this assignment, but I think in the end I was able to solve each of the challenges. I'm very proud I stuck with it and didn't give up. In particular, numbers 3 and 5 were challenging.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
    - We can repeat the same logic without needing to copy the same code. It saves us time and also makes code less cluttered and easier to read.
